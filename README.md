# IvyBridge

As part of the assignments of Interface Circuit Design course students had to present a seminar on an interface of a computer and the new technology associated with it. My seminar was focused on the Intel Ivybridge CPU which had been released and some of the details was beginning to surface regarding the new technology implemented in the CPU.

This seminar was focused on the details and explaining them to the students at the seminar.
